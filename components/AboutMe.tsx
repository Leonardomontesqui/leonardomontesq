        I was born in Ilo Moquegua, Peru and have lived my life moving from
        place to place. I was fortunate enough to live 6 years of my life in
        Canada and perfect my english. Graduated from the IB program at 16,
        wrote cool research papers at that time related to my love for
        innovative electric machinery. But felt limited in my learning as there
        were no facilities in Lima where a student could get hands on
        experience. This took my passion of building to the digital world, where
        I find myself now.
